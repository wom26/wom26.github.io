### Working Papers

[**Risk-Based Borrowing Limits in Credit Card Markets**](img/jmp.pdf) <br>
Coverage: [FCA](https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/research/interest-rates-risk-based-credit-limits-uk-credit-card-market) <br>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> <span style="font-size:1em;"> Credit card lenders individualize contracts primarily through risk-based credit limits rather than interest rates. To understand lenders’ credit limit choices, I use novel statement-level data on the near-universe of UK credit cards active between 2010–2015 to estimate a structural model of the credit card market. The model explains differences in the shape of lenders’ credit limit distributions through a screening technology that provides lenders with a noisy signal of customers’ risk. I identify model parameters using a novel cost shock that results from the April 2011 case in the England and Wales High Court concerning the mis-selling of payment protection insurance. I use the estimated model to evaluate a counterfactual scenario in which lenders can freely individualize interest rates and credit limits, which the existing environment precludes. As a result, individualized interest rates and credit limits emerge, profits increase, and borrowing becomes more dispersed as a result. </span> </p>

**Screening Property Rights for Innovation**, with [Mark Schankerman](https://personal.lse.ac.uk/schanker/)

<p style='text-align: justify;'> <span style="font-size:1em;"> We develop a dynamic structural model of patent screening incorporating incentives, intrinsic motivation, and multi-round negotiation. We estimate the model using detailed data on examiner decisions and employ natural language processing to create a new measure of patent distance that enables us to study strategic decisions by applicants and examiners. Our model estimates and counterfactuals imply three main findings. First, there is large and heterogeneous intrinsic motivation that significantly improves the effectiveness of screening. Second, extrinsic incentives for examiners only affect screening outcomes strongly when intrinsic motivation is low. Third, restricting the number of negotiation rounds sharply improves the speed and quality of screening. We quantify the social costs of patent screening and find that the annual social cost of the existing system is $32.6bn, equivalent to 6.8% of total U.S. R&D expenditures.  </span> </p>

[**Multivariate Ordered Discrete Response Models**](img/KM20230215.pdf) [(SSRN)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4103429), with [Tatiana Komarova](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/tatiana.komarova/) <br>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> <span style="font-size:1em;"> We introduce multivariate ordered discrete response models with general rectangular structures. From the perspective of behavioral economics, these non-lattice models correspond to broad bracketing in decision making, whereas lattice models, which researchers typically estimate in practice, correspond to narrow bracketing. In these models, we specify latent processes as a sum of an index of covariates and an unobserved error, with unobservables for different latent processes potentially correlated. We provide conditions that are sufficient for identification under the independence of errors and covariates and outline an estimation approach. We present simulations and empirical examples, with a particular focus on probit specifications. </span> </p>
