### Working Papers

[**Risk-Based Borrowing Limits in Credit Card Markets**](img/jmp.pdf) <br>
Coverage: [FCA](https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/research/interest-rates-risk-based-credit-limits-uk-credit-card-market) <br>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> <span style="font-size:1em;"> Credit card lenders individualize contracts primarily through risk-based credit limits rather than interest rates. To understand lenders’ credit limit choices, I use novel statement-level data on the near-universe of UK credit cards active between 2010–2015 to estimate a structural model of the credit card market. The model explains differences in the shape of lenders’ credit limit distributions through a screening technology that provides lenders with a noisy signal of customers’ risk. I identify model parameters using a novel cost shock that results from the April 2011 case in the England and Wales High Court concerning the mis-selling of payment protection insurance. I use the estimated model to evaluate a counterfactual scenario in which lenders can freely individualize interest rates and credit limits, which the existing environment precludes. As a result, individualized interest rates and credit limits emerge, profits increase, and borrowing becomes more dispersed as a result. </span> </p>

***Submitted***

<p style='text-align: justify;'> <span style="font-size:1em;"> We introduce multivariate ordered discrete response models with general rectangular structures. From the perspective of behavioral economics, these non-lattice models correspond to broad bracketing in decision making, whereas lattice models, which researchers typically estimate in practice, correspond to narrow bracketing. In these models, we specify latent processes as a sum of an index of covariates and an unobserved error, with unobservables for different latent processes potentially correlated. We provide conditions that are sufficient for identification under the independence of errors and covariates and outline an estimation approach. We present simulations and empirical examples, with a particular focus on probit specifications. </span> </p>

**Property Rights for Innovation: A Structural Model of Patent Screening**, with [Mark Schankerman](https://personal.lse.ac.uk/schanker/)

<p style='text-align: justify;'> <span style="font-size:1em;"> We develop and estimate a dynamic structural model of the patent screening process. The model incorporates incentives, intrinsic motivation, and multi-round negotiation. We estimate the model using novel negotiation-round-level data on examiner decisions and text data from 54 million patent claims. From the claim text data, we use modern natural language processing methods to develop a new measure of patent distance, which is used to characterise strategic decisions by patent applicants and examiners. The parameter estimates imply substantial, but heterogeneous, intrinsic motivation, with senior examiners less intrinsically motivated than juniors, on average. Using counterfactual simulations, we calculate how changes to agents’ incentives, intrinsic motivation and the bargaining structure affect the speed and quality of patent screening, including errors from granting patent claims that do not meet the patentability standard, and not granting claims that do.  We develop a method to monetize these impacts and thus to construct a “pseudo-welfare” measure of the quality of patent screening.  </span> </p>
